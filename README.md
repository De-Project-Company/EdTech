## Contribution Guidelines

3. Pull origin `git pull origin main`

4. Create a new branch for the task you were assigned to, eg `Assigned page - Name` : `git checkout -b Phoenix`

5. After making changes, format codes with `npm run format`

6. Then stage your files `git add .`

7. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message : `git commit -m "your commit message"`.

8. IMPORTANT: To make sure there are no conflicts, run `git pull origin main`.

9. Push changes to your new branch, E.g: run `git push -u origin Phoenix`.

10. Create a pull request to the `main` 

11. Ensure to describe your pull request.

12. > If you've added code that should be tested, add some test examples.

# Merging

Under no circumstances should you merge a pull requests on a specific branch to the `dev` or `main` branch
